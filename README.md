2. Enhance the styling of the index page.
3. Add Price Information
4. Add if a plan had delays
5. Add Starting Platform instead of the end platform

## Q&A:

- Why was this project created? 
This project was created to provide a journey planner that respects users' privacy. It aims to avoid using bloated JavaScript libraries, trackers, and ads.

- Why is it called 9292chan? 
The name was chosen simply because it was the creator's preference.

- Why are there bugs? 
As a new project, there may be some bugs present. The developer hopes to continue developing the site to address any issues. Users are also encouraged to fork the repository and develop it themselves.

- Why is it slow? 
Since all requests are proxied, the site may experience slower loading times. However, this is done to prioritize user privacy. Additionally, cURL was not used for this project.

- How can I contribute? 
You can contribute by hosting an instance of the site or by starring, forking, and submitting pull requests. Designing a custom logo for the project is also welcomed, and contributors will be credited.
